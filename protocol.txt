Commands can be postfixed with "#<checksum>#".
<checksum> is a 16-bit checksum (4 hex digits) of the preceding bytes.
For example: J59;0;20#01C0#
If ALLOW_NO_CHECKSUM is false, a checksum *must* be present.

Txxx;yyy;vvv
  set trim value for joint yyy (0-2) of leg xxx (0-5) to vvv.

Hxxx
  set body height offset to xxx millimeters.

Pxxx
  set phase duration to xxx milliseconds.

Lxxx
  set leg lift to xxx millimeters

R
  Read configuration from EEPROM.

W
  Write configuration to EEPROM.

C
  Show configuration.
  Custom data in output is a line of semicolon-separated numbers starting with "C;":
  0-17: trim for servos 1-18
  18: height offset
  19: leg lift height
  20: walking phase (step) duration
  21: leg lift duration %
  22: leg drop duration %

Jyyy;xxx;rrr
  Set joystick; drive using forward/backward speed yyy in (mm/sec, positive is
  forward), left/right speed xxx (in mm/sec, positive is right) and rotation
  speed rrr (in degrees/sec, positive is counterclockwise).

Kyyy;xxx;rrr
  As Jyyy;xxx;rrr, but values are 0-100 (100 represents the maximum allowed speed).

Mxxx
  Set working mode to xxx:
  -1 = calibration,
  0 = stance,
  1 = joystick

Qxxx;yyy
