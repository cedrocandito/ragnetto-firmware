Data from Ragnetto to client:

C;xxxxxxx   configuration data
I;xxxxxxx   information
D;xxxxxxx   debug log
E;xxxxxxx   error

Legs are numberes from from left, counterclockwise, starting at 0:
       0  5
     1      4
       2  3


Commands from client to Ragnetto:

Commands can be postfixed with "#<checksum>#".
<checksum> is a 16-bit checksum (4 hex digits) of the preceding bytes.
For example: J59;0;20#01C0#
If ALLOW_NO_CHECKSUM is false, a checksum *must* be present.

Txxx;yyy;vvv
  set trim value for joint yyy (0-2) of leg xxx (0-5) to vvv.

Hxxx
  set body height offset to xxx millimeters.

Pxxx
  set phase duration to xxx milliseconds.

Lxxx
  set leg lift to xxx millimeters

R
  Read configuration from EEPROM.

W
  Write configuration to EEPROM.

C
  Show configuration.
  Custom data in output is a line of semicolon-separated numbers starting with "C;":
  0: current command mode
  1-18: trim for servos 1-18
  19: height offset
  20: leg lift height
  21: walking phase (step) duration
  22: leg lift duration %
  23: leg drop duration %

Jyyy;xxx;rrr
  Set joystick; drive using forward/backward speed yyy in (mm/sec, positive is
  forward), left/right speed xxx (in mm/sec, positive is right) and rotation
  speed rrr (in degrees/sec, positive is counterclockwise).

Kyyy;xxx;rrr
  As Jyyy;xxx;rrr, but values are 0-100 (100 represents the maximum allowed speed).

Mxxx
  Set working mode to xxx:
  0 = calibration 1
  1 = calibration 2
  2 = stance
  3 = joystick
  

Qxxx;yyy
  Set duration of leg lift (xxx) and drop (yyy) as percent of the leg
  movement.
